      title: 'What Makes Us Different',
      content: `DriveOn offers a unique combination of features that set us apart from traditional car rental services.

Our Verified KYC System ensures complete security through seamless integration with DigiLocker. This allows for automatic verification of Aadhaar, PAN, and Driving License documents, making the verification process quick and secure. We require 100% profile completion before any booking can be made, ensuring all users are properly verified.

Our Advanced Filter System lets you find the perfect car with ease. You can filter by brand, model, number of seats, fuel type, transmission, color, price range, rating, location, and real-time availability. Our comprehensive search capabilities and availability calendar make booking simple and convenient.

With Dynamic Pricing, you get fair and transparent pricing that adjusts based on date, time, duration, and demand. Our smart pricing engine includes weekend and holiday multipliers, peak hour surcharges, and seasonal adjustments to ensure competitive rates.

Live GPS Tracking provides real-time location updates every 10 seconds during active trips. This enhanced safety feature gives both renters and car owners peace of mind, with location data stored for 6 months for dispute resolution purposes.

We offer Flexible Payment Options to suit your needs. Choose between full payment or 35% advance payment, with secure processing through Razorpay and Stripe. Remaining amounts are automatically debited, and we handle security deposit management seamlessly.

Our Guarantor System adds an extra layer of security. The guarantor verification process ensures that all guarantors complete KYC verification, providing enhanced trust and security for car owners.

Finally, our Referral Program rewards you for bringing new users to the platform. Earn points when you refer friends, and use those points as discounts on your bookings.`,

      title: 'How It Works',
      content: `For Renters:

Getting started with DriveOn is simple. First, register with your email and phone number, verify the OTP, and complete your profile with all required information. Next, complete your KYC verification through DigiLocker by verifying your Aadhaar, PAN, and Driving License documents.

Once verified, add a guarantor who must also complete registration and KYC verification. Then browse and filter our extensive car collection based on your preferences - brand, model, price, location, and more. Select your preferred car and view detailed information including photos, features, and reviews.

When you're ready, book your car by selecting your preferred dates and choosing a payment option - either full payment or 35% advance payment. Complete the secure payment process, and you're all set. When your trip starts, GPS tracking is automatically enabled for your safety. At the end of your trip, simply complete the booking, and you can submit reviews to help other users.

For Car Owners:

Listing your car on DriveOn is straightforward. Register and complete your profile, then add your car with detailed information including photos, pricing, and availability calendar. You'll receive booking requests and can manage your calendar easily through our platform.

During active trips, you can monitor live GPS tracking to see where your car is in real-time. Payments are processed securely through our system, and you'll receive timely payments for all bookings. You can also receive and respond to reviews from renters, helping build your reputation on the platform.`,

      title: 'Technology & Security',
      content: `DriveOn is built on modern, secure, and scalable technology to ensure the best possible experience for our users.

Our frontend is powered by React and Vite, providing a fast and responsive user interface. We use TailwindCSS for modern, mobile-first design that works seamlessly across all devices. State management is handled through Redux Toolkit, while React Query ensures efficient data fetching and caching.

On the backend, we use Node.js with Express.js to provide robust API services. Security is paramount, with JWT-based authentication ensuring secure access to all features. Real-time tracking updates are powered by Socket.io, and we use Node-cron for automated pricing calculations and reminder notifications.

For data storage, we rely on MongoDB for flexible and scalable data management. Redis handles session management and caching to ensure fast response times. All images and documents are securely stored using AWS S3 and Cloudinary, providing reliable and secure cloud storage.

Our platform integrates seamlessly with key services. DigiLocker OAuth2 handles KYC verification, while Razorpay and Stripe provide secure payment processing. Firebase powers our push notification system, and we have robust real-time GPS tracking with background location services.

Security is at the core of everything we do. We implement end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data, secure document storage with proper access controls, real-time fraud detection systems, and maintain location data for 6 months for security and dispute resolution purposes.`,
