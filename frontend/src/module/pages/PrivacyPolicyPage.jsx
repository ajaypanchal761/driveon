Last Updated - 07 October 2025

At DriveOn, your trust is our most valuable asset and we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how DriveOn India Private Limited ("DriveOn", "We", "Us", or "Our") collects, uses, shares, and safeguards your personal data when you interact with our platform on our website www.driveon.com, services, mobile applications, and other digital interfaces ("Platform")—whether as a Host, Guest, or Visitor.

We understand the importance of secure transactions and transparent data practices. Whether you're browsing, booking, or listing a vehicle as a Guest or Host, we want you to feel confident in how your data is handled.

This Policy outlines:

What types of personal data we collect and why

How we store, process, and share this data

Your rights and choices regarding your data

How to contact us in case of questions or concerns

By visiting or using the Platform, providing your information, or availing of any service, you expressly agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, along with our Terms and Conditions and other applicable policies available on the Platform. Please note, DriveOn's products and services are offered only within India, and your personal data will be processed and stored in India at our registered office: No. 147, 1st Floor, Anjaneya Techno Park, HAL Old Airport Road, Kodihalli, Bangalore, Karnataka - 560008.

 

1. Collection and Use of Personal Data

To deliver a safe, reliable, and seamless experience across DriveOn's Host-Guest ecosystem, we collect and use various categories of personal data from users interacting with our platform, services, or vehicles ("You", "Your", "User"). The types of data we collect to operate and improve our services efficiently and securely in compliance with applicable laws, including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 and the reasons for such collection are detailed below.

a. Information You Provide

We collect the following types of personally identifiable information when you create an account, book a trip, list a vehicle, update your account profile, contact customer support, participate in referrals or reward programs or otherwise interact with the DriveOn Platform:

Identity & Contact Information: Full name, email address, mobile number, photograph, gender, date of birth, and postal address(es).

Government ID & KYC: Aadhaar, Driving License, or other government approved identification/address proof documents

Vehicle Information: Applicable only to Hosts

Mandatory: Registration Certificate (RC) and valid comprehensive insurance of the vehicle.

Based on Applicability: Other documents such as the Pollution Under Control (PUC) Certificate, and applicable permits.

Financial & Payment Data: PAN, bank account details, UPI/credit/debit card details (as required), cancelled cheque (as and when applicable) and transaction histories.

Professional Data (for corporate users or business partnerships): KYC details of authorised signatories/representatives, business registration, GST, TAN, and associated entity records.

Miscellaneous: Any other items of sensitive personal data or information, as such term is defined under the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data of Information) Rules, 2011 enacted under the Information Technology Act, 2000.

You voluntarily consent to the collection and processing of your personal data when you register on or use the DriveOn Platform. Such usage shall be deemed as your consent for the purposes specified under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.

In certain cases, where additional permissions are required (e.g., for accessing your mobile device's location), your explicit consent at the time of activation will be treated as valid consent under applicable laws.

b. Information We Collect

When you access the DriveOn platform or use our services, we may automatically collect certain technical and behavioural information. Where this data is or can reasonably be linked to your identity (e.g., via account login, device ID, IP address), we classify it as personal data. This includes:

Device & App Usage Data: Device type, operating system, IP address, browser type, language preferences, unique device identifiers (IMEI, MAC, etc.), crash logs, and app interaction data tied to your user account.

Cookies & Web Beacons: Session cookies and analytics tools that collect behaviour linked to your user profile or IP address. Used for session management, analytics, personalized content delivery, and fraud detection. You can manage these via your browser settings.

Platform Navigation: Session timing, viewed pages, clicks, search terms, interaction patterns, referral URLs, and exit paths tied to your login session, to optimize user experience.

Location Data: If you have granted permission, GPS-based real-time or one-time location, linked to your ongoing booking (outlined under "Location Data & Trip Monitoring") will be collected.

Note: Some of this data may also be collected in a de-identified or aggregated manner. In such cases, it is addressed under Section 3 titled "Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information".

c. Location Data & Trip Monitoring (User Device and Vehicle Hardware-Based)

With your explicit consent and the type of access you grant, we collect real-time location data during the course of active trips to ensure safe, transparent, and accountable trip experiences. Location tracking will occur through the following mechanisms:

User Device-Based Tracking

When you begin a trip, we will request access to your device's location depending on the consent you provide within the app:

One-Time Access captures only the pickup and drop coordinates (Trip Start and End).

Continuous Access enables live location tracking throughout the trip duration to assist with real-time route monitoring, delay detection, and in-trip safety events. This tracking begins at the trip start time and ends automatically once the vehicle is returned.You may withdraw consent at any time by disabling app-level location permissions in your device settings.

GPS Tracker-Based Tracking (Host Opt-In Model)

If the vehicle you have booked is equipped with a GPS device or telematics device installed by us (with the Host's consent at the time of onboarding), we will also collect vehicle-based location data during the trip. The type of device installed may vary depending upon various factors such as business requirements etc., and we may periodically replace or upgrade these devices to support evolving service features and system capabilities. These devices may collect:

Live Location & Route History: Captured for safety support, trip monitoring, theft recovery, and operational efficiency.

Vehicle Diagnostics: Includes ignition status, and fault codes.

Driving Behaviour: Speed motions, braking, idling, and acceleration to prevent misuse and improve experience.

Tamper Alerts & Immobilizer Control: Some vehicles may be equipped with telematics devices that support tamper detection and remote immobilization. In such cases, if interference with the device is detected, we may receive alerts and, where required, initiate immobilization to enforce trip rules or assist in vehicle recovery. This feature is dependent on the type of device installed and is not accessible to Hosts.

The installation of GPS tracking hardware is fully optional and activated only after the Host provides express consent during the vehicle onboarding process. This vehicle-fitted GPS system does not track users outside the booking period and is disabled post-trip.

Your location derived from either of the methods or both will be used to:

Ensure safety and provide enhanced trip monitoring and geofencing logic.

Help in detecting route deviation and locating the vehicle during delays or emergencies.

Assist in real-time road-side assistance, accident response, or recovery.

Verify return timelines and prevent misuse through anti-theft alerts.

Provide retrieval support in case of system failures or mobile app uninstalls.

In case of critical delays or suspected safety concerns, we may share Guest location with the associated Host, strictly for security purposes.

In both cases, any collected location data is securely stored for up to 6 months to resolve post-trip disputes, incidents, or legal queries (e.g., challans or accident reporting), after which it is automatically deleted. We may be required to retain some portions of this data under applicable laws for longer periods.

You may withdraw consent anytime via your device's location settings. However, denying or withdrawing location access may limit or prevent use of certain services, including initiating a booking.

Note: DriveOn does not track your live location outside the trip window.

d. Third-Party Source Data

Where permitted by law or necessary for operations, to verify your identity, validate documents, ensure regulatory compliance, and safeguard platform integrity, we may collect or supplement your personal data from third-party sources in accordance with applicable laws. These third-party sources may include, but are not limited to:

Government & Regulatory Portals

We may retrieve information from publicly accessible government databases such as:

VAHAN/RTO portals for vehicle registration, chassis verification, or permit status checks.

GSTN Directory (in case of Fleet Operators) to verify business registration.

UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India): To validate identity and address information linked to Aadhaar, subject to applicable laws and user consent.

Public Legal and Law Enforcement Records

We may consult publicly disclosed traffic violation/challan portals, or consumer complaints if relevant to the performance of a booking or associated legal risk.

Public Business or Professional Listings

Where required for fraud prevention or business onboarding, we may validate information made public on:

Official company websites.

Business aggregators.

Voluntarily disclosed professional profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, JustDial, Google Business).

Third-Party KYC, Insurance, and Verification Services

We may partner with regulated and government-affiliated third-party service providers for KYC, document verification, driving license validation, or biometric checks (if legally permitted and explicitly consented to by the user). These service providers are contractually bound to handle your data securely and only for the specified purpose.

Such data will continue to be classified as non-personal unless or until it is linked to an identifiable individual.

a. Technical and Operational Usage Data

We collect limited technical and operational data through your interaction with our platform, mobile application, or services. This may include information that, while not actively used to identify you, may still be linked to your account or device in some cases. Such data includes:

Aggregated insights from anonymized user activity (e.g., demographic stats, total page views, heat maps, feature usage trends) to produce statistical insights, audience segments, and trend analyses.

Technical telemetry not linked to a user account (e.g., app crash logs without login, session diagnostics).

De-identified navigation trends such as total page views or usage patterns.

Network and app performance data required to maintain service availability and troubleshoot issues..

Such data is used to analyse usage patterns, optimize platform performance, improve user experience, and inform business decisions.

Note: While some data may not be directly used to identify individuals, we do not currently implement full anonymization or irreversible de-identification processes. Accordingly, such data may still be considered personal data under applicable laws and will be subject to protections set forth in this policy.

 b. Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
